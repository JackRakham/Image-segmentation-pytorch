# Human Segmentation using Deep Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to perform human segmentation using deep learning with PyTorch.

## Description

The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to:

1. **Environment setup:** Installing necessary libraries such as `segmentation-models-pytorch`, `albumentations`, and `opencv-contrib-python`.
2. **Dataset download:** Cloning the Human Segmentation Dataset from a GitHub repository.
3. **Data preprocessing:** Preparing the dataset for training.
4. **Model training:** Defining and training a deep learning model for human segmentation.
5. **Model evaluation:** Evaluating the performance of the trained model.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Human_Segmentation.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells.
3. Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve segmentation results.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.10 or higher
- segmentation-models-pytorch
- albumentations
